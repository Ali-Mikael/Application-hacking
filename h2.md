## X.1) Broken access control
> OWASP Top 10: <https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/index.html> (link added 21.1.2026)     
> Note: I have abbreviated _Access Control_ to _AC_ in some instances!     

**A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**     
- Common AC vulnerabilites
  - Principle of least privilege violation.
  - Bypassing AC checks by tampering with the URL, internal app state, the HTML page or API requests
  - Insicure direct object references, meaning someone is able to view or edit another account by providing it's unique identifier.
  - API access with missing AC for POST
  - Privilege elevation
  - Metadata manipulation
  - CORS misconfiguration

**How to prevent?**
- Deny by default / principle of least privilege
- Implement AC mechanisms once, and re-use through application
- Disable web server directory listing and make sure file metadata and backup files are not present within web roots
- Log AC failures and implement alerts
- API rate limiting     


## X.2) Fuzzing
> Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf <https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuzz-urls-find-hidden-directories/> (link added 21.1.2026)

**Background:**
- Web servers often have non-linked secret directories
- You could try finding them manually by typing all the possibilities, but `fuff` can do it automatically!
- Fuff is a web fuzzer (created by joohoi - <https://github.com/joohoi>)

**Get fuzzing**
- Easy to install: `$ sudo apt-get install ffuf`
- The tool is installed, still need a wordlist/dictionary. For example: <https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists>
- Then specify wordlist and target and get going:
  - `$ ./ffuf -w common.txt -u http://<target>/FUZZ`
  - `-w` flag for **wordlist**
  - `-u` flag for **target url**
- Helpful:
  - `./fuff ` gives you params and filters to use with the tool     


## X.3) AC vulns and privilege escalation
> <https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control> (link added: 21.1.2026)

**What is Access Control?**
- Put simply, it answers two questions, **who?** && **what?**
  - "_What actions_ is an _entity X_ allowed to take?"d

**Vertical AC**
- Restrict access to sensitive _functionality_ to specific type of users

**Horizontal AC**
- Restricts access to _resources_ to specific users

Context-dependent AC
- Restrict access to functionality and resources _based upon the state of the application, or the user's interaction with it_

Note:
- The rest of the article gives examples on common vulnerabilities and broken AC
- Check the task `X.1` above for that!


## X.4) Writing reports

**The meat and bone:**
- _Repeatability & Clarity_
  - Write everything down as clearly as you can, so that somebody following along (doing everything you did), can arrive at the same exact outcome
  - This may include, but not limited to:
    - Computer specs
    - Environment
    - Timestamps
    - Internet connection
    - etc..
  - Also remember to report on any failures and unexpected stuff!
  - Remember to include troubleshooting methods/steps
- _Easy to read_
  - Use clear language and check spelling
  - Use headings
  - Write just enough, don't be tedious!
- Always reference any material you use!


**The no-no zone:**
- Straight up lying
- Plagiarisation
