# Task 0
> Create a small program and compile it to binary or bytecode. Analyze the result.

## Execution
I created a small python file called *program1.py*
```py
age = input("What's your age? ")

print("Nice, your age is", age)
```

## In order to compile it, I executed the following steps:

Create a virtual environment for python:
```
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages henv
```

Switch to the virtualenv:
```
$ source henv/bin/activate
```

Install `pyinstaller` using pip:
```
$ pip install pyinstaller
```

Then compile the program:
```
$ pyinstaller --onefile program1.py
```

It created 2 directories: `build` and `dist`, and 1 file: `program1.spec`

The executable (binary) is stored in `dist`:

We can now run the executable as we would with any other program:

If we want to view the binary in a more "user friendly" format, hexdump is here to help:      
```
$ hexdump <program_file>
```

We can also notice, there's 465 336 lines of hex, so no need to go through the whole file.
