### First things first
> What's an Information Security Management System a.k.a ISMS?     

Simply put = You can think of it as a framework for InfoSec within an organization. It is = the policies and procedures that systematically guide the management of InfoSec.       
The main purpose of an ISMS is to apply the CIA triangle (Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability) on data.
