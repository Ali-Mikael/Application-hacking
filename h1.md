# Scope first, controls later.
> Target environment: home network
> Objective: Define the ISMS-scope, identify interfaces and produce documentation that is auditable (on paper)

## A) Basics
Assigment:
- Draw up the ISMS-scope for your own network and/or study lab.
- Describe atleast:
  - What is included in the scope
  - What you are filtering and why
  - Key interfaces

### First things first
> What's an Information Security Management System a.k.a ISMS?     

Simply put = A framework for managing information security within an organization.      
You can think of it as the policies and procedures that systematically guide the protection of an organization's information assets.        
The system ensures that InfoSec risks are managed using the CIA principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).
