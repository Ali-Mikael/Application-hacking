# Scope first, controls later.
> Target environment: home network     
> Objective: Define the ISMS-scope, identify interfaces and produce documentation that is auditable (on paper)     

### First things first
> What's an Information Security Management System / ISMS?     

Simply put = A framework for managing information security within an organization.      
You can think of it as the policies and procedures that systematically guide the protection of an organization's information assets.        
The system ensures that InfoSec risks are managed using the CIA principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).

# Task A): The basics
Assigment:
- Draw up the ISMS-scope for your own network and/or study lab.
- Describe atleast:
  - What is included in the scope?
  - What you are filtering and why?
  - Key interfaces     

## The scope
The ISMS-scope covers the home network and all connected devices that are used by the student, as well as information assets.     

**Network infrastructure:**
- Internet connection (ISP link)
- Router
- Wireless LAN      

**Devices:**
- Lenovo ThinkPad L490 / OS: Ubuntu
- MacBook Pro / OS: MacOS
- Kali Linux VM / Host: Lenovo ThinkPad
- Raspberry Pi         

**Information assets:**
- Personal files (documents, backups etc..)
- Credentials (Wi-Fi passwords, SSH keys etc..)
- Router configuration data
- Study notes / School related data
- Course material (sources): <https://hhmoodle.haaga-helia.fi> && <https://terokarvinen.com>     

**Software and services:**
- GitHub (Repository management)
- VirtualBox & KVM/Qemu (Virtualization software)
- iCloud (Cloud based storage)
- GitHub repository: <https://github.com/Ali-Mikael/Application-hacking/>      


### Filtering
The scope excludes the following devices (allthough connected to the same home network): a laptop, a smartTV and a smartwatch.     
The watch & laptop are not in the students ownership, and the smartTV is outside the scope of this course.

# B) Standards
> Objective: Identify at least 2 interested parties in the context of the home network.     
> Connect them to:     
> - Security/Privacy/Availability     
> - ISO 27001 requirements (context, leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, improvement)     
> - Evidence     


| Interested Party | Security/Privacy/Availability | ISO 27001 Requirements | Evidence |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| Student (owner)  | Protecting sensitive data, maintaining functional equipment and making sure no risky experiments are conducted outside of the homelab | **Leadership:** Ensuring policies and objectives are met, systems/data/devices are operational and available. **Planning:** prevent, or reduce, undesired effects. **Improvement:** When areas of improvement are noticed and something is done about it (if possible). | Backups, documented configurations, following best practices. |
| University       | Legal use of any provided materials/equipment to complete desired objectives. | **Operation:** Making sure the environment is not affected in a negative way. **Context:** Relevant requirements. | Detailed reporting on tasks/exercises |
